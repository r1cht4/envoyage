# Envoy Bootstrap Configuration
#
# This is the ONLY static config Envoy needs. Everything else (listeners,
# routes, clusters, endpoints) is delivered dynamically via xDS.
#
# Bootstrap tells Envoy two things:
# 1. Who am I? (node.id — used by the control plane to identify this instance)
# 2. Where is my control plane? (the xDS server address)

node:
  # Must match the nodeID in the control plane code.
  # In production, home and VPS Envoys will have different node IDs
  # so the control plane can serve different configs to each.

# ADS = Aggregated Discovery Service
# All resource types (LDS, RDS, CDS, EDS, SDS) are fetched over a single
# gRPC stream. This avoids race conditions where Envoy gets a route
# referencing a cluster that hasn't arrived yet.
